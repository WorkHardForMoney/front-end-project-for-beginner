    <h1>How to store words in an array in C?</h1>
    <p>We all know how to store a word or String, how to store characters in an array, etc. This article will help you understand how to store words in an array in C.</p>
    <p>To store the words, a 2-D char array is required. In this 2-D array, each row will contain a word each. Hence the rows will denote the index number of the words and the column number will denote the particular character in that word.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <ol>Direct initialization: In this method, the words are already known and the 2-D char array is created with these words directly. Syntax for Direct initialization:</ol>
        <ol>By taking input from user: In this method, the number of words and words are given by the user and we have to create and map the 2-D char array for each word. Syntax:
        </ol>

    </ul>
