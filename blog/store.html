        <h1>C Program to Store Information of Students Using Structure</h1>
        <p>Write a C program to store the information of Students using Structure. The information of each student to be stored is:</p>
        <p>A structure is a user-defined data type in C/C++. A structure creates a data type that can be used to group items of possibly different types into a single type.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Get the number of Students whose details are to be stored. Here we are taking 5 students for simplicity.
            </li>
            <li>Create a variable of Student structure to access the records. Here it is taken as ‘student’
            </li>
            <li>Get the data of n students and store it in student’s fields with the help of dot (.) operator
            </li>
            <li>After all the data is stored, print the records of each students using the dot (.) operator and loop.</li>
        </ul>
